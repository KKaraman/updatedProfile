Updated Portfolio

Updated portfolio contains the following:

1. Your full name

2. Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

3. A link to a PDF of my resume

4. A list of all projects and homeworks. For each project, the following is included:

    * Project title

    * Link to the deployed version

    * Link to the GitHub repository

    * Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Portfolio is free of grammar and spelling mistakes

#### Design

* Mobile-first design
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Updated GitHub Profile

1. Professional profile picture

   * A photo or an image other than the default Github identicon.

2. Biography

3. Your current location

4. Email address

5. Link to your portfolio

6. Pin 3-6 repositories that you want to highlight

7. Follow your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.

8. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

   * Title of app
   * Live link to deployed app
   * List of technologies used
   * 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is
   * 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app
