                      I have been very blessed to have wonderful friends and family that have molded my personality over 
                      the years and continue to guide me everyday in my life.  I am also fortunate enough to have traveled much in life due to vacations, my current job in technical 
                      sales for a major oil and gas manufacturing company and the jobs of my parents.  I have been fortunate enough to witness the wonders of nature, captivated by 
                      incredible historical structures and have been immersed in unique cultures in different parts of the world.  I believe that all these experiences and influences 
                      combine to make me the person that I am today.

                  <p> For my personality, I will share the results of what I feel is the most accurate personality test that I have ever taken.  Based on the results 
                    of that Insights Discovery test, I am a very dominant inspirer yellow personality.  When I attended the training, I thought it described 
                    me accurately and here is what that means: </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                         Yellow people are the extravert feelers.  they are more personally involved in the decisions they take and are good in motivating others. 
                         Their motto is: Letâ€™s do it together, and on a good day they know how to motivate others with their enthusiasm.  Yellow people experience 
                         stress when they are restricted in their flexibility, when there is no interaction, or the possibility to have fun. Yellow people respond 
                         to stress by being over-responsive, or by trying to push their though with many arguments. To get out of this situation, yellow people 
                         need to get space to move, save their face or you can simply distract them by changing the topic. 
                        </li>
                        <li>The Inspirer (yellow) is the extravert feeler. These are the creative and convincing people who have people skills. They are not only 
                         good at sharing their own feelings, but also have a gift in reading what other people might need to be satisfied. Inspirers are the people 
                         who make sure everybody in the group feels comfortable, and they love interaction. Inspirers strive for approval and popularity, and they 
                         fear rejection and loneliness.
                        </li>

                    <p>It's very hard to pick only a handful of them but here are also some of my favorite quotes from amazing people:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Mother Teresa: "If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other."</li>
                        <li>Albert Einstein: "It's not that I am smart.  It's just that I stay with the problems longer."</li>
                        <li>Abraham Lincoln: "When I do good, I feel good.  When I do bad, I feel bad.  That's my religion."</li>
                        <li>Ataturk: "One can reach the true delight and happiness in life only by working for the existence, honor and happiness of future generations."</li>
                        <li>MLK Jr: "Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.  Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that."</li>
